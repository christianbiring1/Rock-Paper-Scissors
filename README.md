# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 Is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

## The possible outcomes of the game.

The game has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
